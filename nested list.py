'''
Given the names and grades for each student in a Physics class of  N students, store them in a nested list and print the name(s) of any student(s) having the second lowest grade.

Note: If there are multiple students with the same grade, order their names alphabetically and print each name on a new line.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer, N, the number of students. 
The 2N subsequent lines describe each student over 2 lines; the first line contains a studentâ€™s name, and the second line contains their grade.

Constraints

2 <= N <= 5
There will always be one or more students having the second lowest grade.
